## 📘 *Full Stack Network Automation — The Complete Practical Guide*

This repository is part of the companion resources for the book  
**“Full Stack Network Automation”** — a fully tested, hands-on, real-world guide to Python, Paramiko, REST APIs, Ansible, Docker, GNS3, and Django-based ZTP workflows.

---

This repository is part of Chapter 12 of the Full Stack Network Automation book, where we learn how to authenticate with IOS XE devices using REST APIs, explore API endpoints to pull routing information, and create or view interfaces. We build a Device class and add methods to consume different REST API endpoints.
